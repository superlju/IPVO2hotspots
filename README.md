# IPVO2hotspots
Contains sample scripts to compute hotspots as in Novi et al (2024). It follows the approach introduced in Diffenbaugh and Giorgi (2012) (building on Williams et al. (2007); Diffenbaugh et al. (2008)) and applied by Turco et al (2015). The SED formulation follows the definition in Turco et al (2015). The scripts use CDO (Schulzweida, U. (2022)).
